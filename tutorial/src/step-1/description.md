# Markdown Headings

In this tutorial, you will learn base Markdown syntax.

In Markdown, headings start with `# ` followed by a space, and then the text, making that piece of text a level 1 heading.

Although there are six levels of headings in Markdown, it's not recommended to frequently use headings above level 4.

By the way, there's a button "H" in the top left corner of the editor on the right that can change the heading style, have you checked it out?
