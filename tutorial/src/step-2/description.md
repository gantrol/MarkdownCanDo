# Formatting Text in Markdown

Markdown allows you to format text using simple symbols, making the text appear more varied and rich.

- Bold: Enclose the text with two asterisks `**`.
- Italic: Enclose the text with an underscore `_`.
- Strikethrough: Enclose the text with two tildes `~~`.

These formats can be used alone or combined, allowing your text to be both emphasized and stylish.
