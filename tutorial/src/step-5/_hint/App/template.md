# How to Use Quotes

> I never said that â€”â€” [Paul Graham](https://paulgraham.com/wids.html)

If you want to quote multiple paragraphs, you need to add `> ` before each paragraph.

> Quotes can be long and include multiple paragraphs.
>
> This is the second paragraph of the quote.

> Blank lines without `> `
>
> will split like this

> Without a space, some editors can still convert it to quote format, while others cannot. It's recommended to add a space.

The more `>` you have, the more nested the quote is.

> Try creating a nested quote.
>
> > This is nested content.
>
> > Nested 2
>
> > Nested 3
>
> > > > > Nested
