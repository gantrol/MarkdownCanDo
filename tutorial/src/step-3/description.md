# Markdown Links

Links form the foundation of the internet, and they can greatly enhance the usability of documents and better aggregate valuable content. The "number of links" can well reflect the value of a document, and even note-taking software has designed "bidirectional links."

Through the simple `[link text](link address)` syntax, we can easily add external or internal links.
