# Lists in Markdown

## Unordered Lists

Unordered list items can start with a hyphen `-`, plus `+`, or asterisk `*`, followed by a space before the item:

- List item one
- List item two
- List item three

## Ordered Lists

Numbers followed by a period and a space, e.g. `1. `

1. Red
2. Orange


## Task Lists

The hyphens in unordered lists are replaced with two modes:

- `[ ]` represents incomplete. English square brackets with a space inside.
- `[x]` represents complete. English square brackets with a lowercase x inside.
