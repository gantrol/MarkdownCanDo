# Why Markdown?

Have you ever seen someone format a Word document with spaces and line breaks? Like hitting the spacebar a few times to indent the beginning of a line or pressing enter multiple times to adjust the spacing between lines...

How many people do you think use headings 1 through 6 in Word, and how many of them actually modify the styles of these headings?

What would you do if your colleagues or subordinates spent a lot of time on "space formatting"? Would you teach them yourself, find someone to train them, or would you fire them and hire someone else?

In most scenarios, formatting with Markdown is actually very simple. With just a dozen or so common symbols, one can become a "Markdown coder" in just half an hour.

Of course, for more complex editing scenarios, especially when precise control over image layout is required, Markdown is not recommended. (However, it's worth noting that Word is also extremely complex in terms of image layout.)

Markdown is a plain text format, which means you can easily adjust existing Markdown text with AI. In fact, ChatGPT's responses are in Markdown format.

Moreover, have you considered using Word to draw flowcharts, make PPT presentations, or create mind maps? Markdown can do it! And it's all in plain text â€” you can have AI draw these for you.

Many programmers love Markdown so much that they have developed astonishing features for it. It can be used for TODO lists, emails, resumes, PDFs, formatting for public accounts, and more...

If you are a programmer, then you are likely to prefer Markdown (over HTML).

If you really don't like it, that's okay too, ~~because you have to use it (GitHub, Reddit, Wikipedia...)~~.

Markdown can be used to simplify HTML formatting, and now many frameworks use Markdown to directly generate web pages.

This means that webmasters can focus on writing content without having to code.
